# Etch a Sketch Project
December 12, 2020\
This is my second project combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and took five days to complete. I enjoyed working on this project and learned plenty of things with it. Previously, I was quite unfamiliar with how to make grids. However, during the project, I learned how to not only make grids in JavaScript but how to dynamically adjust them depending on a window's size. The aforementioned brings us to why this project was not a walk in the park. For example, I had to rewrite my original function that would create the grid as it set the width and height of the grid to a pre-decided amount of pixels, which I believe was 500 or 600. This had to change once I decided I wanted the width of the grid to match 80% of the window's width, which came with its own issues. Because the grid must be a square, if the window's height was much smaller than the window's width, the grid would spill beyond the bottom of the window. This was resolved by having the grid match 80% of the window's smaller axis. If the window was taller than wide, the grid's height would be 80% of the window's.
