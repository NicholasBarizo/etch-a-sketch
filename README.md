# Etch a Sketch Project
December 12, 2020\
This is my second project combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and took four days to complete. I enjoyed working on this project and learned plenty of things with it. Previously, the immensely limited knowledge I had on grids was solely in HTML. However, during the project, I learned how to not only make grids in JavaScript but how to dynamically adjust them depending on a window's size. The aforementioned brings us to why this project was also one of difficulty. For example, I had to rewrite my original function that would create the grid as it grid's dimensions to a pre-decided amount of pixels, which I believe was 500 or 600. This had to change once I decided I wanted the width of the grid to match 80% of the window's width, which came with its own issues. Because the grid must be a square, if the window's height was much smaller than the window's width, the grid would spill beyond the bottom of the window. This was resolved by having the grid match 80% of the window's smaller axis. If the window was taller than wide, the grid's width would be 80% of the window's, and the height would copy to maintain a square.
